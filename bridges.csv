The sight of her kneeling praying, as well as the prodigy, who, for a mysterious feeling, the relationship seemed to have co 'cases its , entirely changed the mind of the boatman, and diffilato him into the house, where, when asked if it was true that the Navy had bewitched, and that he wanted to kill him, this crying manifested the love hidden for him in the breast fed , and told him that at that moment I prayed to God to let her die in stead of him.

The hospitable for Incurables was founded in 1522, by insinuation of St. Cajetan of Thiene, by Maria Malipiero and Marina Grimani, who had given shelter in a nearby house to three poor women from S.

In 1523, then there was erected beside a church, which is built in 1566 in most large and consecr� in 1600 under the invocation of SS. Savior. Even the hospitable probably was rebuilt in 1572. With regard to the architects, the disparities between the views, it is useful to believe that the model of the church has given Cav. Antonio Zentani, assisted by Sansovino, and that the factory was accomplished by Da Ponte, which is the main door of the hospitable, and which can be Yea, or in whole or in part, the same hospitable. This beautiful place was intended to first just sick of incurable diseases, but soon after orphans and cherubs are also accepted for educating them in Christian doctrine, nell'arti, and crafts. In effect we know that from 1531 to the Governors of the hospital called St. Jerome Miani, entrusting the care ""yes putti that of the sick,"" who went there taking with him other orphans, who had already gathered in a house near the church of S. Rocco. In the hospitable the Incurable used the same S. Francis Xavier, designed in 1537 to this office with four other companions from S. Ignatius Loyola. The direction of the pious, with regard to spiritual things, was first entrusted to the Clerks Regular of St. Gaetano, and afterwards to the Jesuits of which was Xavier, and lately in memory of Miani, clerics regular Somasca. Pell'assistenza dell'inferme and pell'educazione of the maidens in the early years there were twelve noble women, and for the care of sick some gentlemen, which came to an end as a result, and governors, chosen from among the nobles and citizens , took care of everything coll'ajuto of people employed. After 1782 the Superintendent shrank in the person of a governor only. The maidens educated in this hospice learned the music, and they were celebrated in song. In 1807 the club was the Incurable use of Hospitable Civic, and in 1819 was reduced to barracks, as is found nowadays.

The vineyard, of which we speak, together with the church and a few workshops, was left by will, June 25, 1253, by Marco Ziani Count of Rab, son of the Doge Pietro, the 'Friars Minor', or 'the Friars Preachers', or' Cistercians. "" They were given the preference of the Minor, who stopped stable home. Sprung up as a result the number of them, they had to expand their convent, and erected a new church on the design of Marino from Pisa, which is called S. Francesco della Vigna, leaving intact, however, that of S. Mark, who remained standing until 1810 in the garden of the Fathers. Threatening the church of S. Francesco ruin in the sixteenth century, it was decided to rifabbricarla above designed by Sansovino, and the first stone was laid on the work day on August 15, 1543. Insurgents, however, some dispareri, was for some time intermesso work, and consultossi the friar Francesco Giorgi, who released over the rifabbrica his opinion in writing, he had to comply with the Sansovino. Not even liked the design of the facade designed by this architect, and was chosen another design presented by Palladio in 1562. Allude to these contentions probably the inscriptions that appear in intercolunnii of the two wings, where one side is written: ""Do not sine Jugi inner"" and the other ""Exteriorique beautiful."" Finally accomplished the church, had consecration August 2, 1582 by Julius Superchio Bishop of Caorle. The convent was on that occasion some renovations, but, during the reign of the Napoleonic suppression of religious orders, was, like many others, reduced to barracks. And barracks continued to lend also enabled once the Minor were restored in 1836 in Venice, who went to live next to another convent, founded until the fifteenth century by Maria Benedetta Princess of Carignano, and Maria Angela Canal to the Franciscan Tertiary, monastery monks that they later expanded with the union of the palace of the Nunciature. But in 1866 these abandoned factories, and currently occupy their ancient convent, bought by the ""Commissariat of the Holy Land.""

Varied the number of these canons, leggendosi that in 1393, when the Doge Antonio Venier alquanti they invested, they found themselves at number 26, and that in recent centuries narrowed to 12 only. The houses of their residence were addressed to them by the Doge Ziani. Were rebuilt in 1210 by Angelo Falier, only then Attorney S. Marco, and reduced in stone in 1346. The string in his Additions to the ""Venice"" of Sansovino, published in 1604, which refers to 'his times were 24, arranged as follows: 12 canons resident pei, pei sacrestani 2, 5 sottocanonici pei, pei sottosacrestani 2, 1 pel master of the chapel, and the other 2 pei guardians of the church. The sixth of sottocanonici had also formerly the home, but it had been demolished because, being too close to the basilica, might cause her danger of fire, and in return received from the above-mentioned sottocanonico Procuratia a corresponding compensation in cash. For proof of the same string, then these homes had the look of a convent with a courtyard in the middle, well equipped, and surrounded by porticoes on the floor, and an upper hallway. The entry then, as evidenced by the manuscript work of Todeschini, cited elsewhere, with the title: ""the dignity of the Procurators of S. Marco, ""was on the side of the square of S. Basso.

A proud if born in the year 1456 Canonica di San Marco. It contained a priest in Venice Victor, man of evil nature, and, according to this' superstitious times, linked in friendship with the devil, who held the bag to his rascality ""in the form canis books."" He, knowing that in the Rectory of St. Marco lived a canonical Mauro d'Otranto, wealthy man, he climbed onto the roof of the house with him, and for the fireplace filled the room he inhabited. The canon was then singing in church in the morning, so that pre 'Victor went meanwhile examining where he kept his money, and thereafter, for to await the opportune time, he hid ""in callicella lecti."" When he returned to the canon, if hurled, he struggled long with the same, and it was not until maybe you saw less of forces that broke from the fray, and besought him to let him go. He did agree the canon, and prepared to accompany pre 'Victor outside the door, but these, feigning fear, wanted precede him, and when he reached the end of the staircase, threw a rope around his neck, trying to choke him with his hands Yea. This gave rise to fight more fair; pre 'Victor shook, pre' Mauro biting the hands of pre 'Victor, as long as they brandished his sword, in order to pre' Mauro was girded, and stabbed him in the throat. After that dragged the corpse in the street, threw him on the wood, and began to steal the house. For this crime pre 'Victor was put to the torture, and, having first of the patriarchal vicar Nicholas by Croci, confessed everything, was demoted, and surrendered to the secular, March 19, 1456 that he did hang on the forks.
The ""Ponte di Canonica"" was erected, according to many commentators, after the murder committed over Vitale Michiel II in 1172, and this because the doges were marked with the day of Easter, not for the ""Riva degli Schiavoni"", but for within, to visit the church of S. Zechariah. See Rasse (Calle delle). Others want the same bridge was erected somewhat earlier, ie in 864, after the murder of Doge Pietro Tradonico.

Our Arsenal was founded around 1104, under the doge Ordelafo Falier, but bought the best shape, and was the first addition in 1303, or 1304, when, on the model, as it seems, of Andrea Pisano, there had constructed new sites, as well as the ""Tana"" or ""House of C�nevo,"" afterwards rebuilt in 1579 by Antonio Da Ponte. He got a second addition in 1325 ('New Arsenal'), a third in 1473 (""Brand New Arsenal '), a fourth shortly before 1539 ("" Allocation of Galeazze ""), and a fifth in 1564 ("" Channel of Galeazzo and Bath ""). Other additions followed in 1810 coll'aggregamento of the church and monastery of Celestia, then suppressed, and others in 1820 and 1828, although these very little relief. The complex of these distributions is protected by the turreted walls, forming an enclosure of about two geographical miles.
The entrance of the Arsenale is closed by a gate, advanced-constructed in 1682, with eight statues surmounting the pillars, which include pagan deities, the works of F. Cabianca and G. Comino, and with four lions around of Pentelic marble, brought to Venice from Attica in 1687, to about Francesco Morosini said Peloponnesiaco. The gate, built in 1460 on the design, as it seems, of Friar Giocondo, coll'insegna of S. Mark the attic, was decorated in 1571 by the figures in high relief to the hips, and in 1578 a statue of St. Justina on top, sculpted by Country in memory of the triumph of the Curzolari. It was then converted in 1688 to almost triumphal arch, with warlike emblems and trophies, in honor of the Peloponnesian.
Our Arsenal suffered various conflagrations, the most terrible of which was what happened just before the War of Cambrai, almost foreboding of evil overlying then to the Republic. Another succumbed to serious fire in 1569. Not so, says the Berlan at that time such was the prosperity of the Venetian power, which a year later by that same Arsenal came out of the fleet that destroyed the Turkish naval forces in the Gulf of Lepanto.
The government of the Arsenal was entrusted to the early days, three patricians called ""Superintendents' or 'Patrons Arsenal', to which were added in 1490 by the Senate two individuals of their body, and a third in 1498, with the title ""Sopra Superintendents at Arsenal."" For the tasks entrusted to these two magistrates, and the laws relating to the Arsenale, see mainly the Tentori (""Essay on the History of Civil etc.. Republic of Venice"").

The figure of this angel, from the waist down, it remains covered by two shields noble crossed by a bar, coat of arms repeated on the shaft of the inner courtyard, which we, in the second edition of the ""Curiosity Venetian,"" we said to belong to the patrician family Nani . The Stork on the contrary in its code 3255, now deposited in the Civic Museum, you will find the emblem of the Soranzo. This might leave some perplexity as expressed on the marble, the coats of arms of the Dwarves and Soranzo appear similar, and only expressed in color, differ from each other in this, that the shield of the Dwarves is fine gold and vermilion, while the Soranzo is fine gold and blue. The following, however, discovery, made by Stork, shows quite clearly that he was right in his assertion fullest. At the shore of the building known as ""Angel,"" she read plugged into the wall a surplus of burial Roman inscription which is stated in the 'Collection of Ancient Inscriptions ""of the famous friar Giocondo da Verona glue note:"" Venet. Rivulo in S. Marci, in Ripa D. Lucae Sorantio. "" Soranzo was therefore the building, and as between 'Giocondo dedicated his' Collection 'Lorenzo de' Medici, who died in 1492, we see this occur occurred in the fifteenth century, which fact is confirmed by genealogists with the news that Luke Soranzo, son of Christopher q. Gabriel, was approved pel Great Council in 1419, and in 1432 with Elizabeth ammogliossi Dandolo from S. Benedict. In addition, under the image of the well of the building itself, designed by Grevembroch (Ms. to the Civic Museum) reads: ""Well angelically symbolized the Bridge of the Angel, was Soranzo and then the Barbarighi.""
Returning then to enrollment Roman sovraccennata, which is almost entirely corrupted by the time it goes like this:

D. M.
T. Mestrius
T. L. Logismus

The prof. Peter Pasini giudicolla the surname greek ""Logismus', belonging at the time of the Emperor Domitian, and riput� that this"" Mestrius Logismus ""was a slave emancipated by his good qualities by some member of the family mestria, famous in Venice earth, whence perhaps acquired the name of the land of Mestre.
Then it is curious that the story is said to have given rise to the angel sculpture on the facade of the building. We will draw the ""Annals of the Capuchins' father's Boverio, drawing upon some of the same words to him. He says, therefore, the good friar who lived in the house predicted the year 1552 a lawyer of the Curia Ducale, which, for all he was devoted to the B. See, had increased the entry with dishonest gains. He invited them to dinner one day his father Matthew Bascio, first general of the Capuchins, and a man of most holy life, and told him, before sitting down at the table, to have a monkey in the house good and experienced in a way that served him in all its domestic affairs. He knew immediately the father, by divine grace, which under the guise celavasi a demon, and who allowed herself to come before the monkey, who was lurking under a bed, he told her - I command from God to tell us who you are, and for what reason you joined in this house. - I am the devil or for other purposes here I am led to TRAR me that the soul of this lawyer, who for many titles I should. - Why then, being so hungry you, you have not killed him, and brought thee to hell? - Just because, before going to bed, it is always recommended to God and to the Blessed Virgin that if once he omitted the customary prayer, I, without delay, carried him from the eternal torments. - Matthew's father, heard it, hastened to command the enemy of God soon I'll go out of the house. And by opposing them that he had been given permission not partir top of there without doing some damage. - Well, his father said, do some damage, yes, but that I just want you to prescribe, and no more! Forerai starting this wall, and the hole will serve to witness the incident. - The devil obeyed, and his father, he set to dine coll'avvocato, the shooting of his past life, and in the end dell'ammonizione, picking up one end of the tablecloth, and twisting it, miraculously made it out of the blood in great abundance, saying, be to the blood of the poor whom he sucked with many unjust extortion. Cried the doctor proprii the past, and warmly thanked the cappuccino of the pardon, and to express their fear, however, that hole left by the devil, and calling it unsafe to remain free until the gate to so fierce adversary. But among 'Matthew assured him, and ordered him to put that hole in the image of an angel, imperciocch� would flee at the sight of the holy angels bad angels. This success was so public, concludes the Boverio, a bridge, near the house where scorgesi with the Angel, nowadays is called ""Bridge of the Angel.""
In spite of what is this story, repeated in Segneri (""Christian Instructed"") and Code 481, Class VII, the Marciana with the title: ""Memorable Cases Venetians collected by the gentleman from S. Pietro Gradenigo Giustina, ""with little criterion is attributed to the year of grace 1552 while, besides the painting and sculpture dell'altarino seem older, it appears to be a law of 1502 which until then of the"" Bridge of the Angel "" although not yet erected in stone, bore this name.
