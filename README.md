# venice-islands-geojson

An open-source repository for GIS data mapping the city of Venice.   Originally created for use by WPI VPC in 2024.

isoli.geojson maps the entirety of Venice's historic center, as well as most islands in the area, as multipolygons. ID section is for bridges.geojson reference, to recognize which islands each bridge connects to.

Bridge data (points) is from a 2013 IQP project, but has been updated with recent changes. All bridges in the main city contain geological coordinates, but some outside do not.
